                <p>
                    Kaguya is a beautiful, fair-skinned young girl with long black hair that is usually tied by a black-red ribbon
                    (her hair appears to be mid-back length when she lets it down) with bangs/hair strands hanging on either side,
                    large, almond-shaped red eyes (that can look sharper, depending on her mood), thin eyebrows and a slim, but
                    feminine build, with a noticeably small chest. She is described in her manga character profile as possessing
                    'stunning beauty'.<br><br>
                    In the past, and at the beginning of her time in the Student Council, she always wore her hair down, without
                    her iconic red ribbon. As 'The Ice Princess', her eyes appeared sharper, darker, and lifeless, giving her the
                    aura of a gloomy, cold, unapproachable, and unattainable beauty. This reflected her mental state, influenced by
                    her ruthlessly strict upbringing, where she acted cold towards others, pushing them away because she feared
                    hurting others.

                <p>
                    Later, as she became closer to the other members of the Student Council, (in particular, Miyuki Shirogane) and
                    other students, she asks her maid Ai Hayasaka to make her "cute". The ribbon is her attempt at making appear
                    less imposing and cold to others and marks a shift in her personality. Rather than coldly pushing and distancing
                    herself from others, she starts to form meaningful relationships and becomes brighter, cuter, and happier
                    overall. This change is particularly reflected in her eyes, which no longer looked vacant and distant. Now,
                    her eyes appear wider and livelier.<br><br>
                    She is typically dressed in the Shuchi'in school uniform. However, Shinomiya family policy requires her to have
                    an extensive wardrobe at all times.

                <p>
                    Due to being part of a wealthy and important family, Kaguya is sometimes seen arrogant and is very confident
                    about her intelligence and incredible skills. However this is only an image she displays on the outside. Deep
                    down she is always accompanied with an immense pressure for accomplishing her family's expectations, feeling
                    desperate to do things her friends are able to do on a daily basis.<br><br>
                    While she is a genuinely selfless and kind person at heart, given the unhealthy environment she grew up in, she
                    doesn't consider herself a good person and as such, has a longing for true kindness that borders on obsession
                    which she found in Miyuki. She cares about the members of the student council and considers them as treasured
                    friends. Kaguya has a bad habit of immediately turning to money to solve her problems.
